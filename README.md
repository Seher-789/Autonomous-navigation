# Autonomous Navigation with LiDAR-Camera Fusion and TD3

This project demonstrates autonomous navigation using LiDAR-Camera fusion and the TD3 deep reinforcement learning algorithm in a ROS and Gazebo-based simulation environment.

The system uses LiDAR-Camera fusion to perceive the environment and navigates autonomously using the TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm. Training takes place in a simulated environment built on ROS Noetic and Gazebo 11.
